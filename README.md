## Running the App

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Running Tests

- `npm test`
- When prompted, press `a` to run all tests (by default Jest only runs tests relevant to modified files)

## Assumptions

- "in the last month" means repositories that were first created less than one month ago, where "one month ago" is defined as the result of `moment().subtract(1, 'months')`
